You will build the critical backend systems and services for the website and mobile app that are the core of the business. This includes building the rewards system that will be used to increase driver safety, designing the APIs, creating/managing databases (until we hire a dedicated DBA), and creating automated test suites/manual testing (until we hire dedicated QA).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;General tools you build will be open sourced and will ideally be consumed by the greater community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your team members will also be world class experts and will respect you for your deep experience, commanding technical knowledge, and selflessness. We are just starting building out the team to about 20 developers and you will have veto power over all new software engineer hires in our incredibly flat team structure (CEO. CTO.

It is often said that one of the trickiest accomplishments in the development world is imagining, building and maintaining a complex and interconnected mental model of your entire infrastructure within your working memory. If you have experience applying this mental feat within some type of Software-as-a-Service and want to grow into something new, we have a tremendous challenge for you and a terrific team willing and able to support you through it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;We need crafty humans to help expand the Compose vision. Compose has grown into a vibrant work environment where folks can feel comfortable being themselves, living a balanced life. We welcome you to enjoy comfort when taking risks, collaborate with spirited peers, and to unleash your creative personality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think you're a match?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compose implements blind-hiring! Merit based, objectively graded work samples are the first step. We have worked hard to minimize our own biases as much as possible and find the best possible humans for the team. We respect a fancy education or a list of spectacular previous accomplishments, but nothing is more impressive than the right combination of ingredients - which you can objectively demonstrate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;At any time during the process, we are available to chat (email, video, whatever you like) to ensure you are comfortable with the process and feel that you're being treated fairly and with respect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;We look forward to meeting you!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Please note: At this time we are only able to accept candidates in the United States, Canada, and the UK.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Feb 2016 20:16:45 Z</pubDate><a10:updated>2016-02-29T20:16:45Z</a10:updated><location xmlns="http://stackoverflow.com/jobs/">San Mateo, CA</location></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">http://stackoverflow.com/jobs/84716/backend-engineer-for-onefootball-in-berlin-onefootball-gmbh</guid><link>http://stackoverflow.com/jobs/84716/backend-engineer-for-onefootball-in-berlin-onefootball-gmbh</link><a10:author><a10:name>Onefootball GmbH</a10:name></a10:author><category>go</category><category>api</category><category>websocket</category><category>nosql</category><category>php</category><title>Backend Engineer for Onefootball in Berlin at Onefootball GmbH (Berlin, Deutschland)</title><description>&lt;p&gt;Join us as experienced &lt;strong&gt;Backend Engineer&lt;/strong&gt; and become a vital part of our engineering team by showing your passion for robust and scalable distributed backend services.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your Role&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Write code that your co-workers appreciate for its readability and elegance.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Work on a growing set of backend services that bring the latest scores, match highlights and statistics for hundred of competitions to our users in no time by closely cooperating with our Product team.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Read and analyse data from our data providers, process and deliver it to our user base via the latest web technologies: mobile push notifications, WebSockets and more.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Be responsible for delivering features and APIs on the backend service side in close cooperation with our Frontend and Apps teams.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 26 Feb 2016 14:32:37 Z</pubDate><a10:updated>2016-02-26T14:32:37Z</a10:updated><location xmlns="http://stackoverflow.com/jobs/">Berlin, Deutschland</location></item></channel></rss>
